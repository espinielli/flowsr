```

## External Flight Flows

Read in the city pair flight flows:
```{r}
library(readr)
data_dir = "data/"
extra_flows_file = "extra-flows.csv"

ef <- read_csv(file = paste(data_dir, extra_flows_file, sep = ""))

library(dplyr)
extra_flows <- tbl_df(ef)
rm(ef)
```

## Exploratory Plots

Faceting horiz bar char of movements per city-pair by `year` (take first 20)
```{r echo=FALSE}
howMany <- 20
pairsPerYY <- extra_flows %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  arrange(flights) %>%
  top_n(howMany, flights)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
